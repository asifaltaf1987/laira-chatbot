What types of projects require a literature review?	Projects may include honors papers, capstone projects, theses, dissertations, research articles, grant proposals, and evidence-based practice reports.
What is not considered a literature review?	A literature review is not an annotated bibliography or a research paper supporting one side; it must critically analyze and reflect all sides of the argument.
Why is a literature review important?	It provides background, shows significance, identifies gaps, challenges assumptions, explores themes, and suggests future research directions.
How do I define a good research question for a literature review?	Choose a topic that's not too broad or narrow, conduct preliminary searches, and use frameworks like PICO, SPICE, or ECLIPSE to define key concepts.
What are the key elements of a literature review?	Discuss the theory, explain the methodology used in the research, and identify gaps that your research will address.
What steps are involved in framing a search strategy?	Identify main concepts, conduct a keyword search, find subject headings (like MeSH), and perform a refined search using those terms.
What is the benefit of using subject headings in searches?	Subject headings improve relevance and precision by using database-specific controlled vocabulary like MeSH in Medline or CINAHL Headings.
How should I organize search terms?	Break the research question into 2â€“4 concepts and use synonyms, plural/singular forms, acronyms, and subject headings for each.
What are good databases to search for published literature?	Recommended databases include Cochrane Library, Medline, Web of Knowledge, and SCOPUS.
What are some subject-specific resources?	Resources include CINAHL Plus (nursing), PsycInfo (psychology), and Health Research Premium Collection.

What is the role of Creative Commons licenses in open access publishing?	Creative Commons licenses define how others can use your work. Most OA journals use CC BY, which allows reuse with attribution, supporting wider dissemination.
What are the different types of Creative Commons licenses and how do they vary?	Creative Commons licenses range from the most open (CC BY) to more restrictive (e.g., CC BY-NC-ND). They vary by allowing or restricting commercial use, modifications, and attribution requirements.
